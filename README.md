# MothNet (Python)
------------
A Python implementation of MothNet, from _Putting a bug in ML: The moth olfactory network learns to read MNIST_ by Charles B. Delahunt and J. Nathan Kutz.\
The original Matlab implementation by Dr. Delahunt can be found at https://github.com/charlesDelahunt/PuttingABugInML \
In order to better reflect the idea of the author, the Python code here, including the naming and usage of functions, is structured in an almost identical way to the original Matlab code, and the comments made by the author in the Matlab code are included in the Python code as well.
